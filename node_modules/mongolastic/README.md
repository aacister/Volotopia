mongolastic
===========

Mongolastic is a mongoose middleware which provides automatic index functionality for mongoose objects. Unlike other libs like elmongo this module is based on the official elasticsearch javascript api and provides full access to the api via mongolastic.connection.

It should be registered as plugin and a modelname should be provided.

```js
var mongolastic = require('mongolastic');
var mongoose = require('mongoose');

// connect to mongodb
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/mongolastic');

// connect elasticsearch
mongolastic.connect('mongolastic', {
    host: 'localhost:9200',
    sniffOnStart: true
}, function(err) {
    if(err) {
        console.log(err);
    } else {
        console.log('Connected to ElasticSearch');
    }
});

// define the costume schema
var CostumeSchema = mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
});
CostumeSchema.plugin(mongolastic.plugin, {modelname: 'costume'});
var costume = mongoose.model('costume', CostumeSchema);
// add additional functions to the model and create the index with the mapping
mongolastic.registerModel(costume, function(err, res) {
  console.log('model registered and mapping created');
});

var CatSchema = mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  date: {type: Date, default: Date.now},
  // this is a sample for a additional mapping
  url: {type: String, elastic: {mapping: {type: 'string', index: 'not_analyzed'}}},
  // automatic population of references to the index + select fields to populate
  costume: {type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId, ref: 'costume', elastic: {popfields: 'name'}}
});

// modelname is important to provide the correct index for the model
CatSchema.plugin(mongolastic.plugin, {modelname: 'cat'});
var cat = mongoose.model('cat', CatSchema);
// add additional functions to the model and create the index with the mapping
mongolastic.registerModel(cat, function(err, res) {
  console.log('model registered and mapping created');
});
```

## Additional new functions
- References can be automatically saved as denormalized (populated) version in the elasticsearch index.
- Recursive population of documents
- Render a specific mapping for document types
- Sync function
- Sync function as much more performant bulk operation
- Registration of save handlers per model. These are needed to execute advanced save handling functionality after the document has been saved to the mongodb

By the way... mongolastic is a core component of the upcoming molecuel CMS. [https://github.com/molecuel](https://github.com/molecuel)
